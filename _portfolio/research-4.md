### Theoretical Research on Autonomous Vehicles Based on ROS2  _September 2022 â€“ January 2023_

![Research4](https://travidp.github.io/ROS2LOGIC0418.jpg)

-**1. System Development:** Built perception, localization, path planning, and MPC tracking nodes on ROS2 with Ubuntu 22.04.

-**2. Node Design:** Implemented publish-subscribe topics in C++, simulated and debugged in the Gazebo environment.

-**3. Path Planning:** Applied RRT for pathfinding and MPC for control, incorporating SLAM for mapping.

-**2. Multi-Objective Optimization Method:** Proposed a multi-objective optimization method utilizing dynamic programming to balance travel time, energy consumption, and battery lifespan. The method was tested on both fuel and electric vehicle models, demonstrating its applicability in cost control for mining operations.

-**3. Results and Trade-Offs:** It adjusted acceleration and coasting frequencies for varying road gradients. It achieved Pareto optimal solutions, reducing travel time and velocity fluctuations while enhancing battery lifespan, though with a slight increase in energy consumption, representing a trade-off between efficiency and energy use.

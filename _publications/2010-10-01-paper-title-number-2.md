excerpt: 'In the domain of mining transportation, conventional scheduling and human controlled approaches often result in diminished efficiency and suboptimal outcomes, encompassing resource wastage, increased energy consumption, and safety risks. Byintegrating Deep Q-Network (DQN), a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) system, with the dynamic programming trajectory optimization method, the efficiency of mining transportation can be enhanced, thereby reducing waiting times and energy consumption. The proposed approach seeks to enhance the fleetâ€™s decision making capabilities pertaining to payload management, queueing duration, and the quantity of trucks in the waiting queue. The approach is valid in the simulator
several times. It results in better performance compared to the conventional fixed schedule (FS) and shortest queuing (SQ) strategy. The dispatching policy generated by the DQN algorithm demonstrates more balanced tasks between dump sites and shovel sites. It shows robustness in handling unplanned truck failures.'
